# Chatbot with rule based responses
This is a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules, using if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.

# Define the rules
Created a dictionary where each key is a possible user input, and each value is the corresponding chatbot response.

# Implement the chatbot logic
Using if-else statements or pattern matching, the chatbot can match the user's input with predefined rules and generate a response.

# How It Works:

**User Input:** The chatbot takes the user's input.

**Response Matching:** The input is matched against predefined rules using a dictionary. If a match is found, the corresponding response is returned.

**Default Response:** If no match is found, the chatbot provides a default response indicating it didn't understand the input.

**Conversation Flow:** The conversation continues until the user inputs "bye," at which point the chatbot ends the conversation.
